# iOS Multiple Modal

This iOS Multiple Modal contains three view controllers - A main view controller, a first child view controller, and the second child view controller under the first one.

## What this app can do?
1. The first view controller contains a button to open a modal.
2. The second view controller contains two buttons, to direct to the next modal, or back to the first view controller
3. The thrid view controller contains two buttons, to back to the previous modal, or back to the first view controller

## Language and framework
It's purely Swift (sorry but Objective-C is not my favorite, OOF), and using Storyboard (UIKit). I will create another project for purely SwiftUI in the future.

## Startup
Just clone the whole repository into your local file. It's recommended to use Xcode 13 and above. The minimum deployment version is iOS 15.0.
